People who create things for a living often have a portfolio of things to show. In my experience, it's difficult for a tester who isn't automating apps, or in management to showcase their wares. This page is my attempt at highlighting what I'm working on outside of my 9 to 5 job.

NB: This page is very much a work in progress. It's been published in order to get feedback from peers on where this can be improved.
