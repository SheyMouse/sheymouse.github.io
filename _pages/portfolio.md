People who create things for a living often have a portfolio of things to show. In my experience, it's difficult for a tester who isn't automating apps, or in management to showcase their wares. This page is my attempt at highlighting what I'm working on outside of my 9 to 5 job.

NB: This page is very much a work in progress. It's been published in order to get feedback from peers on where this can be improved.  

## #LeadershipThoughts on Twitter and LinkedIn
Personal project to share my thoughts on leadership with the community. I semi-regularly post a thought about leadership on Twitter and LinkedIn under the hashtag #LeadershipThoughts. First and foremost this is to challenge myself to think about my leadership journey. Secondly, it is to provoke conversations to help others on their leadership journey, particularly those starting out.  
Here is the list of tweets - [#LeadershipThoughts](https://twitter.com/search?q=\(%23LeadershipThoughts\)%20\(from%3ASheyMouse\)&src=typed_query&f=live)
