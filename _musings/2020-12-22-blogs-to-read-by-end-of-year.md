As my final week of work draws to a close I thought I'd bring together a short list of blogs and blog posts to read before the new year.

## Go check these out

Chris and Bruce did a co-retro for 2020. Read them here:  
[Chris: "All my life I've been good but, now what the hell..."](https://christovskia.blog/2020/12/21/all-my-life-ive-been-good-but-now-what-the-hell/)  
[Bruce: "Personal Development 2020 Retro"](https://undevelopedbruce.com/2020/12/20/paired-2020-retro/)  

As you will see from each post, they challenged each other to write these posts. They were released simultaneously on 21/12/2020.  
I really like the accountability idea of writing posts.  
Content-wise, both posts are packed full of personal retrospective items, many of which I relate to. After reading each post, I am tempted to try a 2020 retrospective myself. I fear I may not be able to make time now until 2021. But if I do it, dear reader, I will publish is on this blog.  


<i>This is a live post. I will update when I remember anything worth reading.</i>
