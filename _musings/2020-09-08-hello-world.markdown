*Welcome*

Welcome to my new blog space! I'm currently working on combining some of my blogs into a sort-of "master blog" where I can reference the various sections from social media, etc. 

I'm still trying to familiarise myself with all syntax of markdown, and also figure out what I want the blog-of-blogs to look like. So please be patient while that happens. 

*What to expect on here?*

At the time of writing, I'm not 100% sure. I know I want to migrate my primary blog, [Mouse's Musings](http://mousesmusings.blogspot.com/), to here. Or maybe just start again with the blog and reference the old one as an archive. 
I also post semi-frequently on social media under the hashtag [#LeadershipThoughts](https://twitter.com/search?q=(%23LeadershipThoughts)%20(from%3Asheymouse)). I thought I could have a section which I would mirror the posts onto and put a short explanation on why I felt that though to be relevant. 
Finally, I have [The LifeLong Pubrun](http://lifelongpubrun.blogspot.com/) blog which I want to get back to blogging on. So I think I'll have a section for posts on that which I will direct readers to. 

Anyway, watch this space. I haven't implemented comments yet, so if you read this and want to wish me luck, best to do it by shouting out to me on Twitter [@SheyMouse](https://twitter.com/SheyMouse).
