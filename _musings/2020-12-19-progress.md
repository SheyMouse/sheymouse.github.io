I built this site nearly four months ago now, and haven't really done anything with it. I tinkered a bit but that was it.   
Recently I had an idea of having a portfolio that I could refer to in my CV, LinkedIn, and social media. I have built the page. Or at least got the MVP built. It's a 0.1 version, but does contain most if not all of the information I intend to convey on the page. At least, convey to date. So, go and visit the [portfolio](/portfolio) page to learn more.  
I've not got round to adding the 100 Games repos to a page, or start expanding my tweets on the Leadership Thoughts page. I'm sure that will come at one stage.  
I really like the idea of updating a blog regularly. I think this will form one of my main goals for 2021. That and become familiar with Cybersecurity. But more on that topic another time.  
I welcome feedback, dear visitor. So if there is anything you would like to see added or removed here, please let me know via the social media links.
