I'm not an expert with a Mac. In fact, it is my least-used operating system. I use "pure" Linux distros more than Macs. However, recent circumstances have meant I need to start using MacOS.
Like all machine set-ups, you have to spend time installing all the software you need. This is no exception. I've spent a couple of days installing software now, with various levels of ease. I'd even say everything to do with the set-up was going smoothly. Until this morning. This morning I attempted to install multiple JDK versions on my machine. The pain I feel, is real.
The aim of this article is to give some pointers so the next time I have to do this, it will be easier. And you, dear reader, will hopefully not have to go down the death march I did to complete the installs.

NB: I am not a developer, nor am I a regular user of MacOS. It takes me a lot longer to make progress on some things. But, the more I do, the more I learn. The more I learn, the easier tasks like this get. #GrowthMindset



[NOTES]
Took ages to install
Oracle now has a license / paywall for commercially using its version of Java
Openjdk site is useless with regard to install instructions
Realised I could use Homebrew
Ran command for 8 & 11
Where the bloody hell is it?
Took a lot of googling. Homebrew page wasn't any help.
Nor were 90% other sites!
