## The Second Post
### (Where we see Shey starting to get familiar with things)

I've done a lot of behind the scenes configuration. I am attempting to apply a theme to the site called minimalmistakes (as seen in the footer).
There are a lot of files for me to look at and try to make heads or tails.

I've added my Crashbug to the top left of the site. It's an 88px version of this one:
